======

To generate the build files you'll need the lates cmake version (3.1.0) from here:
http://www.cmake.org/

Optionally you need to have doxygen installed:
http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html

SETUP:
The you should run the program cmake-gui and select the root directory of this repository and a directory where you want the build files to be generated.
Additional step for Windows:
	- Add an entry called SFML_ROOT and select Path as Type. Here you need to specify the path to your SFML Root Folder

Click configure and select your compiler. You can now choose if you want documentation to be generated by doxygen (UngroupedEntries->Build Doc).
Afterwards you should be able to generate the buildfiles and see them in the output directory you specified.

DEVELOPMENT:
If you want to add any new files you need to add them to the src folder inside the repository root. If you added the files just repeat the SETUP steps, so they
are part of your buildfiles.
